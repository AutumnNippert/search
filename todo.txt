(D) change fatal to be an exception +utils
(D) fix segfault that sometimes occurs in fatal +utils
(D) in the +plat2d heuristic, don't consider going up longer than you can jump
(D) merge closed list and hash table:  ClosedList needs reference to domain to call dom.hash, but HashTable uses Ops::hash.  We should be able to handle both cases in one implementation.
