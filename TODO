• visnav specific closed list

• Make sure that the size of grids
	doesn't overflow the size
	of a signed integer

• Port tiles PDB code from C

• Bit-packed pancake states

• visnav: O(n lg n) alg for visnav

• gridpath: 2poly to convert a grid
	map to polygons

	- need to detect non-polygons
		like the boarder around
		the maps
