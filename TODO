• lots of benchmarks

• fix segfault in fatal

• remove dependency on
	boost-filesystem

• plat2d:

	- random start locations

	- better transposition
	breaking.  Should be easier
	because the new Transition
	code has access to both the
	current and next state when
	setting revop.

	- drawing of the solution
	path and the set of expanded
	nodes

• visnav:

	- verify solution paths

	- specific closed list

	- VisGraph contains PolyMap
	Then make 2 PolyMaps
		1) PolyMap
		2) BoundedPolyMap

	- cheaper lineseg hits test

• gridnav:

	- verify solution paths

	- make sure that the size of
	grids doesn't overflow the
	size of a signed integer

• tiles:

	- PDBs

• pancake:

	- bit-packed states

• geom:

	- fix polygon tests

• More domains:

	- Dynamic robot path finding

	- Robot arm

	- Multiple sequence
	alignment

	- Roadmap path finding

	- Hanoi

	- Topspin

	- Rubik's cube

• More algorithms:

	- ARA* monitoring

	- DTA*

	- LSS-LRTA*

	- EES

• Data structures

	- Red/black tree

	- Skip list (compare with RB
	tree)
