<stk5> You could also make Ops the third parameter of Htable, so you
can give it a default argument that's a class that just does k.hash()
and then you won't have to make up Ops classes for things that will be
stored by value


applyinto takes a State& and a PackedState& to fill in and returns a
State&.  The State& argument doesn't need to be used, it is just a buffer
that may be used if needed.  This is way, states where PackedState==State
can just fillin and return the PackedState, but other domains can use
the State& buffer.
