• use Epsilon instead of the numeric_limits trash

• use Inifinty instead of the numeric_limits trash

• 2poly:

	- component class

	- min/max cell based
	poligonization

	- rename to vis

• plat2d:

	-  heuristic: vis graph but
	don't allow vertical > max
	jump frames.

	- play: draw doors

	- play: no repeat on
	jump and act

• visnav:

	- bounding box to prune
	links to out-of-bound verts.

	- O(n lg n) alg for visnav

	- don't fatalx on read fail
	it prints Success…

	- specific closed list

• gridnav:

	- Make sure that the size of
	grids doesn't overflow the
	size of a signed integer

• tiles:

	- PDBs on disk

	- use PDBs for search

• pancake:

	- Bit-packed states

• geom:

	- more tests

• utils:

	- return string from encode/decodes

• More domains:

	- Dynamic robot path finding

	- Robot arm

	- Multiple sequence alignment

	- Roadmap path finding

	- Hanoi

	- Topspin

	- Rubik's cube

• More algorithms:

	- ARA* monitoring

	- DTA*

	- RTA*

	- LSS-LRTA*
