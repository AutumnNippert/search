• use Epsilon instead of the numeric_limits trash

• use Inifinty instead of the numeric_limits trash

• some kind of search node sharing/cleanup

• plat2d:

	-  heuristic: vis graph but
	don't allow vertical > max
	jump frames.

	- Don't require the level to be split
	in half.  Instead, properly detect the
	outter bounding polygon.

	- play: draw doors

• visnav:

	- bounding box to prune
	links to out-of-bound verts.

	- specific closed list

• gridnav:

	- Make sure that the size of
	grids doesn't overflow the
	size of a signed integer

• tiles:

	- PDBs on disk

	- use PDBs for search

• pancake:

	- Bit-packed states

• geom:

	- more tests

• More domains:

	- Dynamic robot path finding

	- Robot arm

	- Multiple sequence alignment

	- Roadmap path finding

	- Hanoi

	- Topspin

	- Rubik's cube

• More algorithms:

	- ARA* monitoring

	- DTA*

	- RTA*

	- LSS-LRTA*

	- EES
