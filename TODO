• lots of benchmarks

• plat2d:

	-  heuristic: vis graph but
	don't allow vertical > max
	jump frames

• visnav:

	- grid2poly: detect outter bounding
	polygon

	- allow a bounding outter polygon

	- specific closed list

• gridnav:

	- make sure that the size of
	grids doesn't overflow the
	size of a signed integer

• tiles:

	- verify that PDBs are correct

	- PDBs on disk

	- use PDBs for search

• pancake:

	- bit-packed states

• geom:

	- fix polygon tests

• More domains:

	- Dynamic robot path finding

	- Robot arm

	- Multiple sequence alignment

	- Roadmap path finding

	- Hanoi

	- Topspin

	- Rubik's cube

• More algorithms:

	- ARA* monitoring

	- DTA*

	- RTA*

	- LSS-LRTA*

	- EES

• Data structures

	- Red/black tree

	- Skip list (compare with RB tree)
