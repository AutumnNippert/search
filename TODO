• search

	- fix cost comptation. Due to
	inconsistency updates, the g
	value of a node is sometimes
	not the correct cost value. Need
	to compute the cost by traversing
	the path in the domain code.
	This is probably a good idea anyway
	because 1) no need to store opcost
	in the search nodes and 2) no
	excuse not to validate the solution
	path.

• utils

	- fix segfault in fatal

	- unit test Steve's safeops

• plat2d:

	- random start locations

	- better transposition
	breaking.  Should be easier
	because the new Edge
	code has access to both the
	current and next state when
	setting revop.

	- drawing of the solution
	path and the set of expanded
	nodes

• visnav:

	- verify solution paths

	- specific closed list

• gridnav:

	- verify solution paths

• tiles:

	- PDBs

	- linear conflicts

• pancake:

	- bit-packed states

• More domains:

	- Dynamic robot path finding

	- Robot arm

	- Multiple sequence
	alignment

	- Roadmap path finding

	- Hanoi

	- Topspin

	- Rubik's cube

• More algorithms:

	- ARA* monitoring

	- DTA*

	- LSS-LRTA*

	- EES

• Data structures

	- Red/black tree

	- Skip list (compare with RB
	tree)
