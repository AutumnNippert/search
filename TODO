• lots of benchmarks

• plat2d:

	- 2poly just emits the
	polygons

	- better transposition
	breaking.  Should be easier
	because the new Transition
	code has access to both the
	current and next state when
	setting revop.

	- heuristic: vis graph but
	don't allow vertical > max
	jump frames

• visnav:

	- rand: just emit polygons

	- visgraph: implement a
	binary that reads polygons
	and makes a visibility graph
	then outputs that.

	- verify solution paths

	- grid2poly: detect outter
	bounding polygon

	- allow a bounding outter
	polygon

	- specific closed list

• gridnav:

	- 2poly just emits the
	polygons

	- verify solution paths

	- make sure that the size of
	grids doesn't overflow the
	size of a signed integer

• tiles:

	- verify that PDBs are correct

	- PDBs on disk

	- use PDBs for search

• pancake:

	- bit-packed states

• geom:

	- fix polygon tests

• More domains:

	- Dynamic robot path finding

	- Robot arm

	- Multiple sequence
	[alignment

	- Roadmap path finding

	- Hanoi

	- Topspin

	- Rubik's cube

• More algorithms:

	- ARA* monitoring

	- DTA*

	- LSS-LRTA*

	- EES

• Data structures

	- Red/black tree

	- Skip list (compare with RB
	tree)
