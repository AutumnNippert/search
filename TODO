• visnav specific closed list

• Make sure that the size of grids
	doesn't overflow the size
	of a signed integer

• Port tiles PDB code from C

• Bit-packed pancake states

• visnav: O(n lg n) alg for visnav

• gridpath: 2poly to convert a grid
	map to polygons

	- need to detect non-polygons
		like the boarder around
		the maps

• visnav: fail with bad arguments

• plat2d/draw: cmd-line args

• plat2d: draw the level as a raster
	image

• More domains:

	- Dynamic robot path finding

	- Robot arm

	- Multiple sequence alignment

	- Roadmap path finding

	- 2d scroller path finding

	- Hanoi

	- Topspin

	- Rubik's cube

• More algorithms:

	- ARA* monitoring
