<stk5> You could also make Ops the third parameter of Htable, so you
can give it a default argument that's a class that just does k.hash()
and then you won't have to make up Ops classes for things that will be
stored by value

* Re-simplify applyinto.  Only wrap kids if they pass the hash table test

* A* should pick a better hash table size based on memory capacity.
