You can build with either GCC or clang.  If one or the other doesn't
work then it is a bug so please tell me.  When building with clang,
you still need GCC in order to build the dependency files because clang
doesn't support the -MM or -MG flags yet.

Ubuntu package dependencies:
	libboost-dev

The plat2d/play binary and graphics code also need:
	libsdl1.2-dev
